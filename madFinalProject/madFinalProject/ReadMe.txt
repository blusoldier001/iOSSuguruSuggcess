Suguru SugCess!

Features:

- Game: 5 Easy (5x5), Medium (6x6), and Hard (8x8) puzzles can be played within the app. You can switch between puzzles using the menus that open when you click on easy, medium, and hard. There are four major buttons. For hint, it will autofill one new block with the correct number. For solve, the whole board is solved automatically. For Check Answer, it will check and see if the puzzle is finished properly and display a message. For Clear, it will clear the board to the initial state.
- Scan + Algorithm: To scan the board, we take an initial puzzle and have to do a little processing. A few examples will be added to the google document that is included in this submission. In order to properly scan the puzzle, we need to include the initial numbers as themselves, or B if the block is blank, and a group number to denote the groups of blocks that are within a bolded block together. The scanning must be done with the phone held horizontally and with good lighting, etc. The app will let you know if the board was properly scanned in when you press display puzzle. After that, it's also important to check that the board was properly read in. The solving algorithm is then run when the user clicks hint, solve, or check answer in order to correctly display the board and the success/failure message. The algorithm is a backtracking algorithm and that fills the true values of each of the cells so that the puzzle can be solved, so you can solve the puzzle as you would in any of the built-in games.
