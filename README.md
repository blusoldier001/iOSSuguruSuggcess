# iOSSuguruSuggcess
iOS application written in switch that generates allows the player to play games of Suguru (a bit like Sodoku). The application incorporates a backtracking algorithm that able to solve any Suguru game that can be feasibly solved. The application can also access the user's camera and directly import a game through a picture.

This is the only public repository of this project that I know of.
I worked on the backtracking solution algorithm.
